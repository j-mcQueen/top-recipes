            <h2>Creamy Chorizo Pasta</h2>
            
            <p>This is my (rather moreish) midweek staple. It's just too good not to have at least once a week. A family member initially introduced me to a variant of this dish, which didn't have chorizo and included mozarella. Over time and experimentation, it became the dish I came to love.</p>

            <h2>Vegetarian Bolognese</h2>

            <p>When I first wanted to reduce the amount of meat I ate on any given week, I asked a vegan friend of mine what his midweek staples were. To my surprise, one of the first things he suggested was a vegan bolognese that used mirepoix as the meat substitute.</p>

        <div id="recipe-3">
            <h2>Broccoli Pesto Pasta</h2>

            <p>I once crashed at my friend's place over a summer in London and a few recipes of his caught my eye. My love for pasta knows no bounds, and he introduced me to this delightful dish that combines citrus and earthy flavours impeccably.</p>
