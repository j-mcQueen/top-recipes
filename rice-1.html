                        2 knobs of coconut oil
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        1 onion, diced

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Meaure out your rice to preference, then tip into a colander and wash thoroughly until the water runs clear. Submerge in water and set aside.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Grind up the cashew nuts in a food processor to as close to a powder as you can get it. Add in the onion, purée, garam masala, turmeric, salt, garlic, yoghurt and lemon juice, then blend again until you get a fairly smooth mixture. 
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Heat the coconut oil in a large frying pan or pot on a medium heat, then add in the chicken thighs and apricots. Fry for a minute or so.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Add in the blended mixture and half the coriander, leaving enough to garnish the dish later. Stir the ingredients together, making sure to fully coat the chicken in the mixture. Continue frying for a further 2 minutes.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Add in the chicken stock, stir, then loosely cover. Turn down the heat and leave to simmer gently for 15 minutes.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        About half way through cooking the chicken mixture, drain your submerged rice, then bring a pot of water to the boil and add in the rice. Stir once, then leave for 4-5 minutes.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Because the rice has been washed and submerged, the cooking time reduces drastically. Periodically fork out some rice as it is cooking and taste. Remove from the heat when the rice is cooked to your liking. Drain in a colander, then return the rice to a pot and cover. Set aside and leave to steam for 3 minutes.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Meanwhile, check your sauce. By now, it should be reasonably thick and not too watery. After the rice has finished steaming, serve up!
                    </li>
                </ol>

                        This recipe has been taken from the cashew nut chicken page inside <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sunil-Vijayakar-200-Curries-Delicious/dp/B00NBCLXT6" target="_blank">this curry book</a> by Sunil Vijayakar (would thoroughly recommend it - the recipes within are fantastic). The original recipe inside has been adapted slightly to the instructions and ingredients you see on this page.
