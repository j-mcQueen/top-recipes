# reciperack

This project was developed as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. Check out the [live version](https://silverwish.github.io/top-recipes/) of my recipe website.

## about this project

- my intention when I first conceptualised reciperack was to create a website that I could refer to when cooking my own meals through the week. So I decided to make it pretty.

As of 10/11/2021: 

- At this stage in The Odin Project course I decided to use this project as an opportunity to test my creativity and design skills. As such, JavaScript has not been used at all, but once my programming skillset has developed further I plan to implement a gallery-style feature to allow users to browse recipes in various categories, hence the name reciperack.

## technologies used

As of 10/11/2021:

- HTML
- CSS
- Coolors (https://coolors.co/)
- getwaves.io (https://getwaves.io/)

## what i've learned

- how to make use colour palettes from coolors and waves from getwaves.io simulatenously to produce a website with stylish and attractive features.
- consolidated my existing knowledge of flexbox
- how to use unique fonts to the website's advantage
- how to apply min-height, max-height, min-width and max-width appropriately to create structurally identical content blocks
- the sweet joy in refactoring code to save time

## notes

I renamed the first two recipe's HTML and CSS files and committed them, unaware that doing so creates new files on GitHub and loses git history. Consequently, to keep the GitHub directory clean I've had to delete the files with the old names (and all the history). Mistake made, lesson learned.
